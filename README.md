# Space Shooter [![Build Status](https://javabilities.com/jenkins/job/Space%20Shooter/badge/icon)](https://javabilities.com/jenkins/job/Space%20Shooter/)



##About
Community video game, anyone can join in or help at any point. All code is open source and written in java using native C / C++ libraries with no proprietary software. This project was created by the students in AP Computer Science A, and is open to the world. The game will be cross platform and free-to-play for 64-bit and 32-bit systems. To get involved with the team check out our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/CObQDpC8/space-shooter)! This game is also based off of an [old game](https://github.com/tsteinholz/OriginalSpaceShooter/releases/tag/1) written in Java by Thomas Steinholz that was never really finished or done right. **Read the [wiki](https://github.com/tsteinholz/SpaceShooter/wiki) to get started if you need help

##Technicalities
### Basic Concept
This game gears to be a robust competitive Player v Player game. In simple terms there will be a lot of mods and plugins to play this game with. Anyone can make changes to the legit game (using this GitHub Repo) or can modify the games to their personal need in a plugin or mod. All of the source is open for the world love or hate. Texture packs are also going too be free to modify. In the Wiki of this GitHub page we will have tutorials on how to Mod, Write Plugin, Make a Texture Pack, and use any of the following features.

### Single Player
This is basically for when you don't have a friend on your LAN, no internet connection, or you are in need of practice. This is just a basic battle between you and the AIs. Have fun.

### Multiplayer
Dedicated Servers will be made to play different games and a friend system will also be implemented so playing with your buddy is possible. LAN networks are also supported and encouraged in work or school environments!

### Plugins and Mods
WIP

### Texture Packs
WIP



##Coding Conventions
We follow the [Google Java Style] (https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html), All of our code is commented as completely as possible as well as Java Documented if possible or appropriate.

##About
Community video game, anyone can join in or help at any point. All code is open source and written in java using native C / C++ libraries with no proprietary software. This project was created by the students in AP Computer Science A, and is open to the world. The game will be cross platform and free-to-play for 64-bit and 32-bit systems. To get involved with the team check out our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/CObQDpC8/space-shooter)! This game is also based off of an [old game](https://github.com/tsteinholz/OriginalSpaceShooter/releases/tag/1) written in Java by Thomas Steinholz that was never really finished or done right. **Read the [wiki](https://github.com/tsteinholz/SpaceShooter/wiki) to get started if you need help
